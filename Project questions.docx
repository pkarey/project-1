#Edits to Questions


How frequently is the given data listening to each genre of music?
- The better question could be "Popular genre across age group"


Based on the frequency of classical (all genres) of music shows improvement (no improvement) with anxiety, aggression, insomnia and or OCD? (this will generate a few questions)
- This is good.


If listening to (given genre) several hours per day this will improve or not improve the mental outcome
- This is good. 


Which is the more prominent group (age) that listens to a specific genre of music?
- This will be covered in the first question.


How likely is someone going to listen to a specific genre of music?
- We can predict based on our findings. (not machine learning algo)


If a higher or lower age group listens (name of genre) this will have a negative or positive impact on mental functioning.
- I do not think we have that information


BPM (beats per minute) over 100 to reflect anxiety, aggression, insomnia and or OCD?
- we can highlight a trend of average BPM per genre to see which genre is most soothing or also any outlier.


Data profiling to clean any missing data -- like on a given day where data is missing How can this influence the data and results of music impacting mental functioning 
- this is good


Additional thoughts:
- Total Survey Participant
- People listening to music while working or not, the most popular genre in either case by age category
- Popular streaming service across age groups, and working or not working
- Identifying outliers/discrepancies 
--- by hours spent on music
--- by checking age, time spent and working or not
--- inaccurate BPM
--- People are listening to the same genre as their favorite 
--- is a person instrumentalist or composer 
--- people using streaming services and they are composers or instrumentalists


-  we can also propose based on this data what business problem can be solved.
--- A genre recommendation based on diseases.
