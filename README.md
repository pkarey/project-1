# Data Bootcamp Project 1
In this project, Patrick K, Jessica S, and Derick N used data from the CSV.file regarding data on Music & Mental Health Survey Results 
Catherine Rasgaitis (Owner of Data)

# Problem: Display the survey results of over 700 participants to reflect on how listening to music impacts mental health
#Data Preparation

Using the starter code we received from [ref_actual_link_of_website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results)

# 1. Analyze: We need to prep data and import data from Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlip

# 2. 
    Step 1 - Add age group to make it categorical
    Step 2 - Make features numerical to make it easy for analysis
    Step 3 - Replace nulls with appropriate values

# 3. Code: Instructions

# Variable Initialization: Store data from our CSV and declare variables used with each function

# Data Input: From CSV
# Data Processing

    #1. Created an age_group variable with age being defined to show the popular genre of music amongst the 700 participants
    #2. Used if else function to determine the age group amongst the data and return an error for all defined age groups
    #3. Display the age of the probability of the age group of users listening to music. Display the results using the print function
    #4. Map string values to numerical values
    #5. Define the bins and labels
    #6. Apply mapping to the 'Frequency [Classical]' column
    #7. Create a data frame for age groups and their popular genres
    #8. Set the style for the plot
    #9. Create a bar plot for the most popular genre by age group and Display it in paragraph 
    #10. Count the number of occurrences of each streaming service in each age group
    #11. Plot the data
    
# Data Output: Displayed in Graphs within Code

# 4 Test: Conclusion 
Results show a higher number of rock music being the preferred genre amongst the participants and that consistent listening to LOFI music produces higher numbers of negative mental impact.
